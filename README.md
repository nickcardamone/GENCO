GENCO is a research project focused on analyzing how Medicare Part D payers adjust coverage and utilization management strategies, such as prior authorization (PA), step therapy, and quantity limits, when novel drugs face initial generic competition. The project uses a comprehensive dataset of drugs approved between 2007 and 2023.
